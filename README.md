---

We all face the problem of spams in our inboxes. Email spam, are also called as junk emails, are unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming).Popular email providers like Gmail use spam classifier programs which can tell whether a given message is spam or not!

Classification is a process of a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data.  For example particular email is spam or not a spam. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field in machine learning with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language. Since emails are in some language, computers first convert them to numbers using NLP so that they can understand them and then classify whether particular email is spam or not.
